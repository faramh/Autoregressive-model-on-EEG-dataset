# Autoregressive-model-on-EEG-dataset
In this project we have applied an AR model (Copyright (C) 2021, Erfan Nozari) on the EEG data set of healthy and Parkinson's disease patients to do forecasting in raw data and koopman-transformed data to check the effect of embedding space reached from Deep Koopman transform
In the Main Codes section there are all of the codes we have used to check and apply the linear AR on different types of data sets we had. Final results are reached using the 2 codes "AR_Koopma_R2.m and AR_koopman_whiteness.m" 

Final results are on the koopman study data sets that the discription are in a .txt file.

Our reports are in 2 pdf files (final results in the "Final Results of auto regressive task - Dr.Martin-Mirian" file)
